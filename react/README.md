What is components?
Ans: Components are Independent and reuseable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JS functions, but work in isolation and return HTML or JSX to be precise.

*The component name should be in upper case always 
eg: funcion App () {
    return
}
export default App;

Q. What is jsx?
Ans: JSX allows us to write HTML in React. Jsx makes it easier to write & add HTML in react.

*jsx must return a single parent element
*jsx element must be properly closed
*jsx attributes are written using camelCase (eg: className instead of class).
